# Pima-Indian-heritage--Diabetes-predictive-analysis
Problem statement:
Diabetes is one of the deadliest diseases in the world. It is not only a disease but also creator of different kinds of diseases like heart attack, blindness etc.Since the disease burden of diabetes is increasing by the day, diagnosis of diabetes at an early stage of the disease is essential for effective treatment and control of diabetes.

Objective:
To identify accurately whether the subject under analysis has diabetes or not based on a set of variables and compare the accuracy obtained from implementing different models.  The Random Forest model gave the highest accuracy compared to Logistic Regression and Decision Tree full-grown and pruned.  We can predict with 78% accuracy whether the person has diabetes or not.

About the DATA:
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.The dataset consist of 768 samples, out of which 500 are non diabetic while 269 are diabetic people.The dataset has total 9 attributes out of which 8 are independent variables and one is the dependent variable i.e. target variable which determines whether  patient is having diabetes or not.

Conclusion:
Random Forest model has highest accuracy compared to Logistic Regression and Decision Tree. We can predict with 78% accuracy whether the person has diabetes or not.
